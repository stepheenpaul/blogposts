If you're looking to increase the traffic to your blog on Hashnode, there are a few strategies you can try to help you go from zero to thousands of visitors.

Here are some tips to get you started:

1.  Write high-quality content: The most important factor in driving traffic to your blog is to create content that is valuable, informative, and well-written. This means doing thorough research, using clear and concise language, and including relevant images and examples to illustrate your points.
    
2.  Use relevant keywords: Keywords are the words and phrases that people use when searching for information online. By including relevant keywords in your blog titles, headings, and body text, you can improve the visibility of your blog in search engines and attract more traffic.
    
3.  Promote your blog: In order to get more traffic to your blog, you need to promote it to your target audience. This can be done through a variety of channels, including social media, email marketing, guest posting on other blogs, and participating in online communities related to your niche.
    
4.  Engage with your readers: Building a community around your blog is a great way to increase traffic and keep people coming back for more. Make an effort to reply to comments, share other people's content, and participate in online discussions related to your blog's topic.
    
5.  Optimize your blog for mobile: More and more people are accessing the internet from their phones and tablets, so it's important to make sure your blog is mobile-friendly. This means using responsive design, optimizing images for mobile devices, and making sure your site loads quickly on all devices.
    
6.  Use internal and external links: Including internal and external links in your blog can help to improve its search engine ranking and attract more traffic. Internal links help to organize your content and make it easier for readers to navigate your site, while external links provide additional context and resources for your readers.
    
7.  Track and analyze your traffic: It's important to track your traffic and analyze the data to understand where your visitors are coming from and what they're interested in. This can help you to identify what's working and what's not, and make adjustments to your strategy accordingly.
