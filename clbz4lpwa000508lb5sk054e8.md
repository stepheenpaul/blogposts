Heroku, a cloud platform for building, running, and managing applications, has announced a partnership with GitHub, a platform for developers to collaborate on code, to offer a Student Developer Program.

The program aims to provide students with access to the tools and resources they need to learn how to build and deploy applications on the cloud.

As part of the program, students will receive a free Heroku Developer account and access to a range of resources, including tutorials, documentation, and support. They will also be able to use GitHub's collaborative development tools, such as pull requests and code review, to work on projects with their peers.

The Student Developer Program is open to any student aged 13 or older who is interested in learning how to build and deploy applications on the cloud.

> Heroku gives students a credit of $13 USD per month for 12 months. After 12 months, accounts will be charged for active services or they must spin down their resources to avoid charges.

To join the program, students must create a GitHub account and sign up for the program through the GitHub Education portal. Visit here to get started: [https://www.heroku.com/github-students/signup](https://www.heroku.com/github-students/signup)

The partnership between Heroku and GitHub is a valuable opportunity for students to gain practical experience in cloud development and build their skills in an increasingly important field. With access to the tools and resources provided by the Student Developer Program, students will be well-equipped to succeed in their future careers as developers.

In addition to the free [Heroku Developer account](https://blog.heroku.com/github-student-developer-program) and access to GitHub's collaborative development tools, the Student Developer Program also offers students the opportunity to participate in community events and hackathons, where they can learn from experienced developers and network with their peers.

They will also have access to support from the Heroku and GitHub communities, where they can ask questions and get help with their projects.
